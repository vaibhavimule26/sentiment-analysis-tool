# Sentiment Analysis Tool

This project is a Sentiment Analysis Tool developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
and Machine Learning techniques. It classifies text data into positive or negative sentiment.

## Objective
To analyze text data and determine the sentiment expressed in it using a supervised
machine learning approach.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression

## Dataset
A publicly available movie-related dataset was used for training and testing the model.
Sentiment labels were generated based on rating thresholds.

## Project Workflow
- Data loading
- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Train-test split
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation
- Sentiment prediction on new input text

## Results
The model achieved approximately 60% accuracy on the test dataset.

## How to Run
Open the notebook file in google colab and execute al cells sequentially.
